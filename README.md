### I simply make ideas come true.
#### Web & Desktop Developer

I am an all-around web developer. I am a programmer with 6 years of experience and good knowledge of working on both front-end and back-end sides. Started working on desktop applications since 2018 years ago. I love structure and order and I also stand for quality. Also, I like working in a team, you'll learn faster and much more. As the saying goes: "two heads are better than one".
